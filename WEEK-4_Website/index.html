          <h2>What is it that mobile car detailing services actually do?</h2>
          <div class="fakeimg2" style="height:200px;"></div>
          <p>A mobile detailing business does everything a physical vehicle detailing business does, but at a lower price and in a more convenient way. They bring their high-quality detailing services to you.

          <h2>What should you look for when choosing a mobile detailing business?</h2>
          <div class="fakeimg3" style="height:200px;"></div>
          <p>Your car is too important and too expensive to just trust anyone with.  Before deciding on a mobile detailing business, you should take the following things into consideration:

            Legitmacy
            You want to be sure that the mobile detailing business that youâ€™re trusting with the care of your vehicle is a legitimate and successful business. You want to ensure that all of their employees are fully capable of handling your vehicle with care and taking extra care to ensure the vehicle detailing is done accurately and well.</p>
